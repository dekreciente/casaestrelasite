            <p class="staywithus-text">We don't work with open calls or selection processes; you just need to send us an email to present yourself and your plan for the stay, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
            <p class="staywithus-text">Here are some things to have in mind when you contact us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="staywithus-lists">Who you are as a person and as a practitioner? </li>
                <li class="staywithus-lists">What would you bring to the residency: questions, ideas… </li>
                <li class="staywithus-lists">How do you relate to the ethos of Casa Estrela? </li>

            <p class="staywithus-text"><strong>Prices</strong></p>
            <p class="staywithus-text"><strong>Casa Estrela is a self-organized space sustained by mainly voluntary labor, operating with minimal resources and without subsidies.</strong> The fees were calculated based on the basic needs of the house. Some of these needs take into account common uses such as energy, gas and water expenses, and common consumables such as laundry detergent, toilet paper, trash and coffee, among others. It should be noted that the values contributed by the residents go directly to the project since no one is profiting from the guest's fee. Each resident is responsible for their food. In Casa Estrela we believe that the residency should be as affordable and as accessible as possible; that's why we established three types of rates:</p>

                <span class="tooltiptext">But we can talk about it!</span></span> people to stay around one month because we feel it's a reasonable amount of time to make yourself comfortable in the house and the surroundings.</em></p>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="staywithus-text"><strong>How does the price work?</strong></p>
            <p class="staywithus-text">Payment is due on the day of arrival. You will be refunded if you leave earlier. If you leave earlier without any proper motive, we won't be able to refund the payment.</p>

            <p class="staywithus-text"><strong>How does the solidarity price work?</strong></p>
            <p class="staywithus-text">Let us know why you want the solidarity price, and the whole team will study your reasons. It is important to note that we have a specific amount of solidarity prices during the year. So don't hesitate to contact us and explain why you want the solidarity price. The solidarity price is aligned with the Portuguese minimum wage (estimated at €5.33/hour in 2024). We invite all guests to thoughtfully assess their own income in relation to this standard when applying for a <em>Solidarity price</em>.</p>
